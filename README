| Coders, programmers & NERDS. They are the people who will not need the code in         |
| this git source. But for the rest of us who struggle with programming, the             |
| dreaded technical interview to those "chosen" companies, can be difficult (and         |
| sometimes a crying) challenge. They ask trick questions, language questions,           |
| algorithms and puzzles and top it of with anything they can think under the sun.       |
| Kidding!!! Not anything under the sun, but for us it seems like that. So this is       |
| my small contribution to making, the often challenging experience, a little less       |
| painful.                                                                               |

| The work has a lot of empty files that I hope to fill during my free time. I also      |
| think a bit change in the way the code is implemented, is required.                    |
|                                                                                        |

| This is a set of codes that are part of typical technical interviews or technical      |

| it, to make it work.                                                                   |
